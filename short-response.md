1. Each member would have to make their own branch to work on their own projects/goals.

2. Developers would use branches to make a copy-like verison of main to test features. These could include adding, fixing, or experimenting. This is so they can try it out before making the final decision whether to add it or not.

3. Git is a place where you would write lines of code or create something like a markdown. Meanwhile, github is a place where different developers can look at each other's work and collaborate on it. They work together by someone working on their own work on git and can be displayed to others or give access to them.

4. The thing that is wrong about the command sequence is that it's in the wrong order. They had `git commit -m "saving work"` as the first command. It should be changed with `git add .` which was placed as the second one. Doing this change allows the file or project to be saved first and then set up to be sent out to the repository.

Example:

`git add .`
`git commit -m "saving work"`
`git push`
